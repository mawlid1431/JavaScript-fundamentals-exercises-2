## Functions

1. Write a function called 'describeCountry' which takes three parameters: `country`,`population` and `capitalCity`. Based on this input, the function returns a string with this format: _'Somaliland has 3.5 million people and its captial city is Hargeisa'_
2. Call the function 3 times with input data for 3 different countries. store the return values in 3 different variables and log them to the console.
3. The world population is 7900 million people. Create a function called `percentageOfWorld1` which recieves a `population` value and reutnrs the percentage of the world population that the given population represents. For example, _China has 1441 million people, so it's about 18.2% of the world population_
   > **NOTE:** To calculate the percentage, divide the given `population` value by 7900 and then multiply by 100
4. Call `percentageOfWorld1` for 3 populations of countries of your choice, store the results into variables, and log them to the console

## Introduction to arrays

5. Create an array containing 4 population values of 4 countries of your choice and store it in a varaible called `population`
6. Create an array containing all the neighbouring countries of a country of your choice. Store the array into a varaible called `neighbours`
7. Log to the console whether the array has 4 elements or not (true or false)

## Iteration: for loops

8. Console log one by one the countries inside the `neighbours` array.
9. Console log one by one the countries inside the `neighbours` array but this time in a reverse order.

## Iteration: while loop

10. Do exercise 8 & 9 using while loop
